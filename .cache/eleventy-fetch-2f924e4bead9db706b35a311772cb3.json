But while they’re all keen to use open source, at lot fewer actually contribute to it.</p>\n<p>And yet, there’s real value in doing so. Companies use their contribution to open source to boost recruiting (Facebook claims 75% of their new engineering recruit mention Facebook’s open source program as a key reason they accepted their offer), increase their market, build a moat around their business, or position themselves as leaders in their field.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll look at the different ways contributing to open source can benefit a business and become a competitive advantage. We’ll look at the open source strategies of different companies, big and small, and provide you with the knowledge to start building a business case for open source in your own company.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_2840","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_GaSsuV","type":"image","title":"Making the business case for contributing to open source","desc":{"html":"<p>InnerSource practitioners edition</p>\n<p>Tobie Langel,\nPrincipal, UnlockOpen\n(@tobie)</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-0.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_suBgmu","type":"image","title":"Why should companies contribute to open source?","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-1.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_VDuUfJ","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-2.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_7XdIXi","type":"image","title":"Open source ROI","desc":{"html":"<p>The ROI of using open source is well understood.</p>\n<p>The ROI of contributing to open source: not so much.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-3.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_jrM6Q7","type":"image","title":"Risk","desc":{"html":"<p>The risk of contributing to open source is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not well understood,</li>\n<li>generally exaggerated.</li>\n</ul>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-4.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_MB4uIW","type":"image","title":"The “InnerSource solution”","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-5.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_yUniAv","type":"image","title":"The “InnerSource solution” - Perception","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-6.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_aoWW3K","type":"image","title":"The “InnerSource solution” - Reality","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-7.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_D8FJvj","type":"image","title":"Understanding the value of contributing to open source","desc":{"html":"<ol>\n<li>Strategic benefits</li>\n<li>Second-order benefits</li>\n</ol>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-8.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_pRy7o8","type":"image","title":"Commoditize Your Complement","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-9.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_RlgvgX","type":"image","title":"On-ramp developers","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-10.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_45PjYw","type":"image","title":"Understanding the value of contributing to open source","desc":{"html":"<ol>\n<li>Strategic benefits</li>\n<li>Second-order benefits</li>\n</ol>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-11.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_gP8XRL","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-12.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_IirLJk","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-13.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_v2a9C9","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-14.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_XMIx4Y","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-15.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_9g1kwx","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-16.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_lzkYpM","type":"image","title":"TWICE AS EFFICIENT","desc":{"html":"<p>Contributing firms capture up to 100% more productive value from usage of open source than their free-riding peers.</p>\n<p>Source: Franck Nagle, Learning by Contributing, 2017.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-17.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_OJTMhl","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>75%\nOF FACEBOOK’S NEW ENGINEERING RECRUITS MENTION FACEBOOK’S OPEN SOURCE PROGRAM AS A KEY REASON THEY ACCEPTED THEIR OFFER</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck2840/large-18.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_0dCAaA","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>“But we also noticed some effect that we didn’t expect.
