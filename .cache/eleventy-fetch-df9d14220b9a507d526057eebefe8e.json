As a result, the number of constituencies has ballooned: there are indie and corporate contributors and maintainers, open source software vendors, developers building proprietary code on top of open source, end-users who don‚Äôt know anything about software, people impacted by open source software who are not even using it, cloud providers, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>When the interests of these different actors are in conflict, which one of them do we favor and why? Neither the Four Freedoms nor the Open Source Definition (OSD) really helps us answer that question.</p>\n<p>Faced with similar issues, other communities have designed really effective frameworks to guide their decision making processes. W3C‚Äôs ‚Äúpriority of constituencies‚Äù is such a framework.</p>\n<p>In this talk we‚Äôll dig into what W3C‚Äôs priority of constituencies is, outline its benefits, but also its limits.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll then see how we could apply the priority of constituencies to open source, what that reveals about the complexity of the open source ecosystem, and in particular how the parts that are difficult to fit in such a framework are precisely those that have made the news in the past few years.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_7473","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_ZDoT6n","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen\nDoes open source need its own Priority of Constituencies?</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck7473/large-329465-11dbb50f0edcee3e.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_BXXGzC","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-1.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_nrG4rb","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-2.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_QAysk0","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-3.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_2UhgcP","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-4.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_eoQUUo","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-5.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_H89IND","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-6.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_tRs6Fc","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-7.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_Vlau81","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Open source crisis\n‚óè Maintainer burnt out. ‚óè Cloud capturing too much value. ‚óè Ethical concerns over impact on end-users.\nTobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck6236/large-8.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_85Ji0Q","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>What‚Äôs going on?
