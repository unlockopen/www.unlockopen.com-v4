Only 18% thought it was not important at all.</p>\n<p>Facebook ran a survey with its new engineering recruits in 2015—when it was still one of the most desirable Silicon Valley companies to work for—75% mentioned Facebook’s open source program as a key reason they had joined the company.</p>\n<p>In a market where there’s much more demand for software engineers than there is supply, building a strong open source culture is critical to recruit and retain top talent. And promoting it is just as important.</p>\n<p>In this talk, you’ll learn why software engineers care about open source so much, what you can do to foster a strong open source culture, and how you can make sure to effectively promote it to attract—and retain—top talent.</p>\n<p>We’ll then put some of you in the hot seat. We’ll have a look at your online presence from the perspective of a job seeking software engineer and compare it with what the best brands are doing.</p>\n<p>You’ll leave with actionable and personalized takeaways which will help you build a better engineering culture and become more attractive to the kind of candidates you really want to hire.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_4617","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_tPczcS","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-0.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_VjLnUr","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-1.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_834bNG","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-2.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_kMnPFf","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-3.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_MgWD84","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-4.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_z0F10T","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-5.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_bJxoss","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-6.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_DdgclH","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-7.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_pxPQdg","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-8.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_SH8EW5","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-9.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_4ar2OU","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-10.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_guZqGt","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-11.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_JEIe9I","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-12.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_vY1S1h","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-13.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_XrkFu6","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-14.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_ABT3mV","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-15.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_mVBreu","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-16.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_OoufXJ","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-17.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_18dTPi","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-18.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_dSMHI7","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-19.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_Fm55AW","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-20.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_s5nt2v","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-21.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_UPWgvK","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-22.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_6jFUnj","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-23.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_j2yIg8","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-24.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_LMh6YX","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-25.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_xgPuQw","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-26.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_a08iJL","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-27.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_CJrWBk","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-28.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_odaK49","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-29.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_QxJ7wY","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-30.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_3H1vox","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-31.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_fakjhM","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-32.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_HuTXZl","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-33.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_uECLSA","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4617/large-34.jpg","html":null}]}]},"download":"https://on.notist.cloud/pdf/deck-cb16cb6e7605d884.pd
