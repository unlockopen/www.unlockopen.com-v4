And promoting it is just as important.</p>\n<p>In this talk, you’ll learn why software engineers care about open source so much, what you can do to foster a strong open source culture, and how you can make sure to effectively promote it to attract—and retain—top talent.</p>\n<p>We’ll then put some of you in the hot seat.
