They’re designed to protect the company at all costs. But in the process, end up hurting engineering productivity, and morale. Sometimes they even unknowingly put corporate IP at risk.</p>\n<p>But that’s not inevitable.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to write open source contribution policies that make engineers lives easier, boost morale and productivity, reduce attrition, and attract new talent. And it’s possible to do so while reducing the company’s IP risk, not increasing it.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll look at the general structure of contribution policies, examples in the wild, and tactics to make them suck less.</p>\n<p>We’ll also look at how to turn these policies into self-service software, preventing the tedious email back and forth between engineering and legal in most cases and making open source contribution a breeze.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_5262","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_nAI860","type":"image","title":"Open source contribution policies that don’t suck!","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel, Principal, UnlockOpen\ntobie@unlockopen.com</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5262/large-0.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_PU0vyP","type":"image","title":"Do you have an open source policy?","desc":{"html":"<p>Source: The New Stack &amp; Linux Foundation/TODO Group 2018 Open Source Program Management Survey (https://github.com/todogroup/survey)</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5262/large-1.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_1njjqo","type":"image","title":"What does not having a policy mean?","desc":{"html":"<p>Contrary to popular belief, it does not mean that you don’t have an open source policy at all.</p>\n<p>It means that you don’t have a written one.</p>\n<p>You have a policy, whether it is written down or not.
