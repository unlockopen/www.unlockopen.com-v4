As usual, the devil is in the details, and these standards will substantially shape the future of software in Europe, and as a result, of open source.</p>\n<p>The problem?</p>\n<p>The EU standardization organizations which will be tasked with developing those standards (CEN-CENELEC and ETSI) are very formal structures that are as arcane and antithetical to open source communities as the EU legislative process itself was only a few months ago.</p>\n<p>There’s a very serious risk that this upcoming standardization process might happen again with little or no consultation of the impacted open source communities and lead to additional harm as a result, further damaging Europe’s standing in the open source community and its ability to host, foster, contribute to, and leverage open source projects essential to its sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The goal of this session is to preempt this scenario by proactively engaging with policy makers and carving out a path forward that leads to better outcomes for both Europe and open source.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_12156","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_c7TrZR","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>40 new ways the CRA can accidentally harm open source Tobie Langel, UnlockOpen “Open Source In The European Legislative Landscape” devroom Tobie Langel (@tobie) FOSDEM 2024 Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck12156/large-0.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_ERCfRq","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>😅 The CRA has landed.
