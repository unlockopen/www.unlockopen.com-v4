The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M.</p>\n<p>It was soon revealed that the root-cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based.</p>\n<p>In this talk we’ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we’ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_5975","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_lkdgnb","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>Towards a sustainable solution to open source sustainability Tobie Langel, Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5975/large-0.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_O4MUg0","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>The Heartbleed Bug</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5975/large-1.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_0O5IYP","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>Heartbleed bug impact ! 4.5 MILLION\nThe number of US patient records whose confidentiality was compromised.\n” $500 MILLION\nEstimated cost to the industry.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5975/large-2.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_cho6Qo","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>Pivotal moment where tech industry realizes open source is: # UBIQUITOUS\n2/3 of active sites on the Internet rely on the OpenSSL library.\n⚠ CRITICAL\nOpenSSL encrypts private communications, bank transactions, medical records, etc.\n% UNDERFUNDED\nOnly 1 full-time maintainer, shoestring budget ($2k/year).</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5975/large-3.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_F1WuJD","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5975/large-4.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_rLFiBc","type":"image","title":null,"desc":{"html":"<p>&amp; INDUSTRY-WIDE EFFORT\nOrganized by the Linux Foundation.
