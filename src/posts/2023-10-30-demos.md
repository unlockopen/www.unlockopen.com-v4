This is a very opinionated starter, but it can be further developed in many directions. In its current form, it can already be used as a simple blog.

To avoid overloading this base with too many subtleties, I put special features such as image gallery, tags, or pagination in separate branches that (usually... hopefully! ðŸ«£ ) keep up with the main branch.
Work in progress.
