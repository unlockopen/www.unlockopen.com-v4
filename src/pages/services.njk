    Expert On A Mission is a coaching program designed for independent experts who want to
    build a successful business that is also aligned with their mission. Making a
    meaningful impact in your industry with a thriving business involves self-reflection,
    experimentation, and action.

  <p>
    We call this process Strategic Narrative. Unlike what most people think, building a
    successful and meaningful business takes time, effort, and for sure more than posting
    lofty statements on a website and waiting for clients to show up. Power your business
    and yourself with the Strategic NarrativeÂ® methodology.
