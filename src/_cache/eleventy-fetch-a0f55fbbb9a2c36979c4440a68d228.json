As a result, the number of constituencies has ballooned: there are indie and corporate contributors and maintainers, open source software vendors, developers building proprietary code on top of open source, end-users who don’t know anything about software, people impacted by open source software who are not even using it, cloud providers, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>When the interests of these different actors are in conflict, which one of them do we favor and why? Neither the Four Freedoms nor the Open Source Definition (OSD) really helps us answer that question.</p>\n<p>Faced with similar issues, other communities have designed really effective frameworks to guide their decision making processes. W3C’s “priority of constituencies” is such a framework.</p>\n<p>In this talk we’ll dig into what W3C’s priority of constituencies is, outline its benefits, but also its limits.</p>\n<p>We’ll then see how we could apply the priority of constituencies to open source, what that reveals about the complexity of the open source ecosystem, and in particular how the parts that are difficult to fit in such a framework are precisely those that have made the news in the past few years.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_5661","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_eZnd6b","type":"image","title":"Does open source need its own Priority of Constituencies?","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) Principal, UnlockOpen</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-0.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_GtWQz0","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-1.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_tDFErP","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-2.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_VWy2jo","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-3.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_7qgqcD","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-4.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_kAPeUc","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-5.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_MU8SN1","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-6.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_ynrGFQ","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-7.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_b7a47p","type":"image","title":"Open source crisis","desc":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>Maintainer burnt out.</li>\n<li>Cloud capturing too much value.</li>\n<li>Ethical concerns over impact on end-users.</li>\n</ul>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck5661/large-8.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_DRIs0E","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>What’s going on?

Using or developing more open source software is not going to improve anyone’s lives. Developing open source software is not a public good. It’s not going to result in a fairer or more equitable society. In fact, as currently structured, open source development is part of the problem. If you work for one of the companies that stands in the way of intellectual property reform, and you say nothing in protest, then you are part of the problem. So many open source developers and advocates are gainfully employed and at very little risk of losing future work prospects, and yet I see so few speak out about their employers’ role in wealth inequality.”</em>\n—John Mark, Why Open Source Failed, July 30, 2018.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Save Open Source, Save the World","url":"https://medium.com/@johnmark/save-open-source-save-the-world-f2b0bf6ec630","desc":{"html":"<p>John Mark’s less sinister follow-up to his “Why Open Source Failed” piece.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Open Source Has Not Failed.
