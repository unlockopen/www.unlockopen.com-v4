At first, only a few developers tried it out, but soon more developers joined them, companies followed in their path, and you now even have a number of large tech companies using it. As a result, you‚Äôre receiving a steady stream of bug reports and, increasingly, pull requests from contributors all over the world. Your project has a community. It‚Äôs healthy. It‚Äôs growing.</p>\n<p>So far, you‚Äôve been the one setting the project‚Äôs direction, but you‚Äôre well aware this won‚Äôt continue working for long. You need to bring in more people to help maintain the project, and naturally they‚Äôll want a say in how it moves forward. You‚Äôve also heard from other large corporations who‚Äôd be interested to contribute to the project or use it, but require a more open governance model to be able to fully commit.</p>\n<p>The next steps are obvious; you need to move the project to a software foundation.</p>\n<p>But which one should you pick and why?</p>\n<p>In this talk, we‚Äôll look at why you‚Äôd want to move a project to a foundation, and what doing so involves. We‚Äôll give you a solid rundown of the various foundations and related options, and their pros and cons. And we‚Äôll arm you with enough knowledge so you can ask the right question and make the best decision for your project.</p>\n"
