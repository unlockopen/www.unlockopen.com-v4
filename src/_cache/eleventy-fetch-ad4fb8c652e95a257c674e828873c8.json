And it tells us more about its authors than about the open source movement in general; had open source been born in less privileged circles, ethical considerations would have been baked in from the start.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s revisit what we’re actually trying to collectively achieve through the open source movement and reconsider the notion that its mission requires we allow the software we build be used in violation of Human Rights.</p>\n<p>There are minimally-disruptive changes that can be made to the OSD and to existing licenses which would put ethical concerns centerstage, where they belong, and help us foster responsibility and accountability within our community and within software vendors.</p>\n<p>We’ll look at the past attempts at creating ethical licenses and why they have failed. We’ll ask all of the hard questions, even those we don’t have good answers to yet. And we’ll propose a new, multi-pronged approach to this issue. One that we believe, while more demanding to implement, has a much better chance of success than previous attempts have had.</p>\n"},"slidedeck":{"data":[{"id":"sd_4761","type":"images","slides":[{"id":"sl_SarLJr","type":"image","title":"Bringing back ethics to open source","desc":{"html":"<p>Tobie Langel (@tobie) tobie@unlockopen.com</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-0.jpg","html":null},{"id":"sl_4ua9CG","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>First, a disclaimer.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-1.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_hEIx4f","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>…well, two actually.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-2.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_JY1kx4","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<ol>\n<li>[IANAL]: I am not a lawyer.</li>\n<li>[WIP]: This is a work in progress.</li>\n</ol>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-3.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_vrkYpT","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>I don’t have all the answers.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-4.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_YBTMhs","type":"image","title":"","desc":{"html":"<p>Goal: start a conversation.</p>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-226880-8a2c2ea70919fe1a.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_AVCAaH","type":"image","title":"So, what are we going to talk about?","desc":{"html":"<ol>\n<li>A bit of context</li>\n<li>A different perspective on the OSD</li>\n<li>Let’s look at prior art</li>\n<li>What’s missing from it?</li>\n<li>Role of corporations</li>\n<li>What do we get out of this</li>\n<li>Critiques</li>\n<li>Next steps</li>\n<li>Q&amp;A</li>\n</ol>\n"},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-6.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_mouySg","type":"image","title":"Context","desc":{"html":""},"image":"https://on.notist.cloud/slides/deck4761/large-226882-86449023f0edc4bf.png","html":null},{"id":"sl_P8dmL5","type":"image","title":"So... what is this about?","desc":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>Increasing concerns about the negative impact of tech.</li>\n<li>Historical context of tech used at scale in Human Rights violations.</li>\n<li>A desire to do something about it through open source licensing.</li>\n<li>Previous attempts at doing so.
